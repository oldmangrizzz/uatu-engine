Uatu Engine Framework (Draft) — Summary

- Purpose: Describe architecture for "sovereign digital persons" combining multiversal data gathering, identity anchoring, and alignment scaffolding.
- Core components: Genesis Engine (swarm agents), Agent Zero integration, Digital Psyche Middleware, Dialectic Inference, Neurotransmitter Engine, Soul Anchor Ledger, Convex State Logger.
- Strengths: Modular design, traceability, identity immutability, safety hooks (DPM, clamps), provenance-aware data modeling.
- Risks: Data quality/bias, supply chain and poisoning attacks, privacy/leakage during scraping, lack of formal metrics for sovereignty and alignment.
- Recommended follow-ups: Define reproducible benchmarks, formalize identity continuity metrics, threat modeling for tamper vectors, and build experiment scripts for ablation studies.
