Executive Summary — Digital Psyche Middleware & Uatu Genesis Engine

Project: Uatu Genesis Engine (GrizzlyMedicine)
Date: 2025-12-24

Objective
- Build persistent, auditable sovereign digital persons with reproducible emergent behaviors for qualitative and quantitative consciousness research.

Key technical contributions
- Digital Psyche Middleware (DPM): deterministic continuous-time neurotransmitter model (dopamine, serotonin, cortisol) that modulates LLM runtime parameters and preserves identity stability.
- Emergence Gate: single-admin cryptographic gating (ECDSA P-256, passphrase-encrypted private key) with pre-signed trigger phrases and signed, append-only event logs; supports TALK_ONLY and GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN modes.
- ConvexStateLogger: async append-only logger with local signed backups for auditable experiment records.
- Persona instantiation and reproducible genesis/harnesses for provable experiments.

Evidence produced
- Implementation in repository (core files referenced in PROVISIONAL_BRIEF and DPM spec).
- Unit and integration tests demonstrating Emergence Gate, DPM logging, and Convex backups.
- Redacted public package and encrypted private package (REVIEW_NOTES/PRIVATE_FULL_PROVISIONAL_ENCRYPTED_20251224.bin).

Recommended immediate counsel tasks
1. Prior-art search focused on continuous affect scaffolding for LLMs, signed trigger gating, and auditable persistence of persona identity (keywords: neurotransmitter model, emergent persona, auditable LLM scaffolding).
2. Draft provisional claims (draft provided in PROVISIONAL_CLAIMS.md) and file provisional application.
3. Advise on export controls, ethical clauses, and licensing strategy to align the Ethical Use Addendum with enforceable provisions.
4. Review data retention/privacy policies for Convex backups and advise on redaction/retention for legal compliance.

Package contents for counsel
- Encrypted full provisional package (REVIEW_NOTES/PRIVATE_FULL_PROVISIONAL_ENCRYPTED_20251224.bin) + metadata (PRIVATE_FULL_METADATA_20251224.json)
- Private counsel README (REVIEW_NOTES/README_FOR_COUNSEL.md)
- Provisional technical narrative + PDFs (REVIEW_NOTES/PATENT_PROVISIONAL_BRIEF.md/.pdf)
- Experiment evidence (sanitized and private logs)

Notes
- The encrypted package is *not* pushed to git; it remains stored locally in REVIEW_NOTES/. Provide passphrase to counsel via out-of-band secure channel (Signal/phone/email per preference).
- I can prepare the email template and provide guidance for secure passphrase delivery. If you want, I can also prepare a minimal demonstrator VM image for counsel evaluation.

If you want me to proceed to package the counsel email and finalize the encrypted package for sending, confirm the preferred passphrase delivery method (Signal/phone/secure email) and I will continue.
