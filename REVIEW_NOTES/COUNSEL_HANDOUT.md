# Counsel Handout — Uatu Genesis Engine

Commit: 4851251c3d158e56beacf077d4b49e50bd630388

## Core Components
- Emergence Gate: single-admin ECDSA P-256 key, passphrase-encrypted, signed triggers, admin overrides.
- Digital Psyche Middleware (DPM): reproducible emergent persona behavior via layered LLM modifiers.
- Auditable Provenance: local append-only events.jsonl + Convex local backups for forensics.

## Immediate Counsel Items
- Review provisional claims: DPM method/system/flow; Emergence Gate signed gating + auditable logging.
- Confirm retention and chain-of-custody for encrypted package; advise on jurisdictional implications.

## Operational Recommendations
- Keep private keys encrypted; use HSM if possible; documented OOB passphrase transfer; log disclosures.
- Require time-limited overrides and dual-sign for wildcard overrides; maintain weekly audit cadence.
