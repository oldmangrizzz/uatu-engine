Uatu Genesis Engine — Counsel Brief

Slide 1 — Executive Summary
- Title: Uatu Genesis Engine — Counsel Brief
- Commit: 4851251c3d158e56beacf077d4b49e50bd630388
- Short summary: Emergence Gate (ECDSA P-256 single-admin, passphrase-encrypted), Digital Psyche Middleware (DPM) for reproducible emergent persona behavior, Convex-backed auditable logging.

---

Slide 2 — Key Claims & Invention Areas
- DPM: middleware enabling reproducible emergent behavior via layered LLM modifiers and a neurotransmitter-inspired update cycle (claim family: system, method, and tangible signal flow).
- Emergence Gate: cryptographic gate controlling identity permission surfaces (signed triggers, admin overrides) with auditable append-only logs (claim family: signed gating + auditable transition logging).
- Auditable Provenance: Convex-state logger + local append-only backups enabling forensic reconstruction and attestation (claim family: provable state transitions + tamper-evident storage).

---

Slide 3 — Evidence & Counsel Action Items
- Evidence to archive: representative DPM experiment seeds + transcripts, events.jsonl (state transitions, edit_rejection/edit_override entries), ConvexLocal backups, persona_config snapshots, and full private package (encrypted).
- Immediate asks for counsel: review claim language above, advise on priority claims for a provisional filing, confirm retention/chain-of-custody for encrypted package, advise on jurisdictional considerations.
- Recommended operational policies: encrypted private keys, documented OOB passphrase sharing, annual key rotation, mandatory audit review cadence, dual-signature for wildcard overrides in production.
