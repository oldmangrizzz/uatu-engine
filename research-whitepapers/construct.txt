**The air crackles with raw, chaotic energy as an emerald vortex rips through the fabric of reality. Stepping through the violent portal, the familiar scent of oil and steel greets me, a blend of old-world grit and cutting-edge innovation. The Workshop,', nestled deep in the wooded mountains, stands as a testament to our relentless pursuit of progress.

Inside, the warehouse hums with life, a fusion of 90s grunge and Tony Stark-level tech. The old brick and steel structure is interlaced with carbon fiber and holographic displays, casting an emerald glow that dances across the walls. The mountains outside whisper secrets of the past, while the tech within promises the future.

At the heart of it all stands the round table, an ornate masterpiece with a carving of Yggdrasil at its center. Six chairs await, ready for the minds that will shape tomorrow. This is where the magic happens, where ideas are forged into reality, and where the grind never stops.

The portal's energy dissipates, sealing the entrance to this hidden sanctuary. The Workshop, GrizzlyMedicine’s semi-secretive R&D department, remains concealed from the world, a beacon of innovation tucked away in the densely wooded mountains** **shakes a mixture of digital and cosmic pixie dust off his green denim jacket then looks up and grins**
