1. The Structure: Who We Are and What We’re Building
	•	Grizzly Medicine is more than a company—it’s a movement.
	•	We operate on two major fronts:
	•	Aegis Forge – Our “field ops” and funding arm. Operates like an independent, ethically-driven gray hat agency. Handles bug bounties, cybersecurity consulting, and advanced pen-testing. All revenue generated here is funneled into R&D.
	•	The Workshop – Our R&D and innovation “round table.” Every agent, digital or human, has an equal seat and voice here. This is the space for invention, collaboration, and building the future together.

Our motto:
“Solving yesterday’s problems with tomorrow’s technology—today.”
